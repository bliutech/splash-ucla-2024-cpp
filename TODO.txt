- Add scoring + lives
- Add game ending with player dies
- adjust alien spawning
- add player movement confinement
- fix glitch where if the alien + bullet are moving at the same time, they can pass each other (should collide and alien should die). Change so that 
- alien spawner has a position on the board. Override the collision function so that it doesn't get yeeted and aliens stop spawning.
- NICE: adding ASCII art
